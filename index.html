                A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. These elements clearly defines its content. In other terms semantic tags are those tags whose name can easily let you know which type of content take place in it. eg. header, article and footer.<br>
                        
                Non-Semantic Elements:<br>
                        
                Non-semantic element are the element which Tells nothing about its content. In other terms element whose name doesnâ€™t suggest you what they do. e.g. div and span.</p>
